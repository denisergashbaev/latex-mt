\noindent

In this chapter, we provide a detailed implementation of our proposed methodology. We start with presenting the platform we incorporated to shape and design our model. Then we explain our architecture's 
Then we attempt to give insight into the datasets we used to train and test our model. 

\section{Caffe deep learning platform}

Caffe is a clean and modifiable framework for state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and a collection of reference models.
