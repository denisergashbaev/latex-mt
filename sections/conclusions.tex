\label{sec:conclusions}

\noindent In this thesis we have made various contributions to the object representation problem casted as learning to count tasks. Our contributions include 1) a deep algorithm to sufficiently learn object representations without the need for hand-crafted feature detectors. 2) counting th number of pedestrians in images in a privacy-preserving manner involving no object tracking or detection techniques. 3) two synthetically generated and automatically annotated datasets for even-odd hand written digit recognition and crowd counting in the images. 4) a deep architecture trained with synthetic data which is capable of counting pedestrians in a real-world problem. 5)the experimental validation of our improvements with the previous feature detecting techniques as well as with related methods in the state-of-the-art. 

\section{Conclusions}

This work started off with verifying our very first hypothesis, where we hypothesized that deep features learned by deep convolutional neural network can be a surrogate for object detection tasks using manually designed feature detectors. To this end, we configured a deep CNN for an even-digits counting problem. We trained the network with synthetic dataset of up to 15 MNIST digits in the images with the number of even digits as labels (chapter~\ref{subsubsec:digit}). Having a deep model trained, we obtained noteworthy results implying applicability of deep CNN as a surrogate for previous feature detection approaches.

\indent Furthermore, we examined our methodology on a more complex problem of counting the number of pedestrians in a walkway. Applying deep learning methods for supervised learning problem depends upon a large amount annotated data. Exhaustive labeling becomes prohibitive in most of the cases. To overcome this issue, we created another synthetic dataset of pedestrians in the walkway labeled with the number of people present in the images (see chapter~\ref{subsec:synped}). Designing another deep network, once again we achieved noticeable results while discarding extensive labeling effort and hand-crafting feature detectors.   

\indent One our main contributions and the novelty of this work was to evaluate our proposed methodology from a practical aspect by testing it in real-world problems. To this end, we tested our model which was trained with synthetic dataset, on a similar but real relatively small set of images which were labeled manually with the number individuals in the image(see section~\ref{subsec:datareal2}).    

Comparing our model's performance with a related crowd counting study (using manual labeling and feature descriptors) on the same dataset, we may conclude that the application of deep features, not only softens annotation efforts and omits the usage of numerous hand-crafted feature descriptors, but also improves the results of such previous approaches. In addition, preserving individuals' privacy will no longer be a matter of concern since our methodology does not include any object tracking techniques.    

\noindent To sum up, the findings of this Master thesis suggests deep learning techniques as a well-suited surrogate for previous learning to count problems by showing representativity of the learned features for the object of interest in similar but different tasks. It also proposes the usage of synthetic dataset to ease the annotation effort in supervised learning approaches. Last but not least, it substantiates the feasibility of incorporation of such methods in real world problems by alleviating the learning process while improving the results.  

\section{Future Work}

Any research study opens interesting lines of research that deserve further attention and study. There are questions and limitations that need to be addressed along with the improvements that can be made. Our work is no exception. In this Master thesis, we have observed and pointed out shortcomings and areas in which one can improve our work. Some of the deficits of our study along with some hints to advance and enrich this line of research which were out of scope of this work, are mentioned in the followings:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We generated synthetic gray-scale datasets to tackle our proposed problems. Although we did our best to improve the data to make it look as realistic as possible, there are still many other ways to improve the data and undoubtedly the performance of the model. One idea could be feeding colorful images to a deeper network for learning more features and predicting more accurate forecasts.   
\item Due to the intuitive nature of deep networks design, one can configure and design a model more in-tune with the problems. Making the network deeper with more parameters might be an option.
\item Another idea of ours to improve the performance of our crowd counting model on the real dataset is to couple two architecture, one with the synthetic data and label and the other with the real images. In this way, we can use the features learned on the synthetic data architecture for testing the real data simultaneously and update the weights of the training architecture with synthetic samples. 
\item Another approach could be combination of deep CNN to learn to count out of sample. For instance, our even-digits counting dataset contained up to 15 digits. However, one could train a deep network with images with up to 30 digits in each image and label images with the number of all digits in the image and not just even digits. We assume that a combination this model and ours could count the number of even digits in images with more than 15 even digits. The same experiment can be done for counting pedestrian task in order to provide a model capable of counting people in very crowded scenes such as demonstration, marathon, etc. 
\item A combination of such deep algorithm for crowd counting can be combined with faster programs to develop real-time pedestrian detection. Sue to the different size and appearance of real pedestrians, deep algorithms might not be fast enough to detect pedestrians in the moment. However, faster vision detection algorithms such as \textit{cascade detection} can be used in early stages of the system to fasten the detection  process while a deep classifier can improve the accuracy of the algorithm at the final stage. An algorithm with such optimal trade-off between detection accuracy and speed can be used in various industries such as pedestrian detection systems in self-driving vehicles.
