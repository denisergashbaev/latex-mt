%2. What is the background, the context, in which the research took place? 
Learning to count is an important \todo{"educational/developmental milestone" --- hmm, it's smth different. maybe concept or ability} educational/developmental milestone  which constitutes the most fundamental idea of mathematics. In Computer Vision, the counting problem is the estimation of the number of objects in a still image or video frame. Learning to count visual objects is a new approach towards dealing with detecting objects in the images and video, which has been recently \todo{proffered means offered, do you mean that?} proffered in the literature\todo{such as paper1, paper2,...}. It arises in many real-world applications, including cell counting in microscopic images, monitoring crowds in surveillance systems, and performing wildlife census or counting the number of trees in an aerial image of a forest\cite{NIPS2010_4043}\todo{citation missing}.
